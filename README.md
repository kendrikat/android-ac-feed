Tech
-----------

AACF uses a lot of nice frameworks and tools, which should be mentioned, because they make your Android experience better! Besides that this project is kind of playground to get a feeling for using these libraries ... and they should be mentioned, because *sharing is caring*:

* [ActionBarSherlock] - brings the native Android 4.x Actionbar to all devices since 2.2
* [HoloEverywhere] - brings the native Android 4.x Holo-Theme to all devices since 2.2
* [Crouton] - Who wants Toasts when you can have... CROUTONS!
* [RoboSpice] - This is the library if you want talk to APIs with ease! Check it out!

This App is compatible with Android devices from version 2.2 to 4.x. But ActiveCollab API is only supported from version 3.x.
