AACF - Android ActiveCollab Feeds
=========

AACF is a simple App for displaying and sharing status messages through your [ActiveCollab] instance.

  - Display recent status updates
  - Post new updates
  - Share directly through any App (browser etc)

Tech
-----------

AACF uses a lot of nice frameworks and tools, which should be mentioned, because they make your Android experience better! Besides that this project is kind of playground to get a feeling for using these libraries ... and they should be mentioned, because *sharing is caring*:

* [ActionBarSherlock] - brings the native Android 4.x Actionbar to all devices since 2.2
* [HoloEverywhere] - brings the native Android 4.x Holo-Theme to all devices since 2.2
* [Crouton] - Who wants Toasts when you can have... CROUTONS!
* [RoboSpice] - This is the library if you want talk to APIs with ease! Check it out!

This App is compatible with Android devices from version 2.2 to 4.x. But ActiveCollab API is only supported from version 3.x.

Installation
--------------

* Download it
* Goto Settings
* Fill in URL & Token
* Share it!

Limitations
-
Because the [ActiveCollab API] for status messages only allows posting a new message, its not possible to reply to an existing status message. But primary task of this app is to share easily through any kind of app which allows sharing of content. (Browser, Newsreader etc)
